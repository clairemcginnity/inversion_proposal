Overview

This code accompanies the communication Towards Automated Target Picking in Scalar Magnetic Unexploded Ordnance Surveys:  An Unsupervised Machine Learning Approach for Defining Inversion Priors (Claire McGinnity, Mick E. Kolster, Arne Dossing).

We apply our paper's approach to sample survey magnetic data and visualize the results.

Getting Started

Dependencies

All dependencies are listed in the accompanying Pipfile.

Data

We provide data/surveys/benchmark.pkl and data/targets/benchmark.pkl. A second, larger, data set is available upon request; contact clairemcginnity@gmail.com.

Running the code

All code is contained in the notebook propose_regions_for_inversion.ipynb; simply run the code in each cell from beginning to end. Intermediate results will be written to local directories. This local location, along with some hyperparameters, can be configured in cells 2 and 3.
